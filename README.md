Machine Learning Snippets

A playground for my deep learning journey. Future additions also include existing machine learning code (some of which needs refactoring from Matlab) such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), k-means, k-medoids, PPCA, and DPPCA using EM, Hidden Markov Models using the Viterbi algorithm, GPLVM (C++, SCons), and other goodies.
